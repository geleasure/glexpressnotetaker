## Description

For this project, I was given the challenge of creating the back end of a note taking website by using Express.js. I was given the main HTML, CSS and JS, and it was my responsibility to create the back end of the site, so a user could use it as it was intended.

To do this, I had to complete the following:

- Creating the necessary routes so that the index page and notes page loaded when particular parts of the website were clicked.
- Added a server file to create a port so the information in the database would be displayed on the site.
- Create the necessary functions which would allow the user to Create, View and Delete notes.
- Deploy the app to Heroku to get the app up and running.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:geleasure/glexpressnotetaker.git
cd glexpressnotetaker
npm install express cors uuid
```

## Usage

Click on the deployed Heroku link to launch the live app. On the landing page, press the 'Get Started' button to start making notes.
